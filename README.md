# Pocketbook Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple TikTakToe Applikation for Pocketbook, I created to start learning C++ and understand the SDK of Pocketbook. (https://github.com/ezdiy/pocketbook-sdk5)


### Tested on
* Pocketbook HD3 (PB623) (V. U623.6.0.926)

## Screenshots

### Usage
Download and unzip the file from releases and place the nextcloud.app into the "applications" folder of your pocketbook. Once you disconnect the Pocketbook from the PC, the application should be visibile.


## Disclamer

Use as your own risk! 
Even though the possibility is really low, the application could harm your device or even break it.
